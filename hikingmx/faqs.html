                <h4>How far in advance should I register for a trip?</h4>
                <p>You can never register too early, but the ideal booking window is usually the 3â€“5-month time frame. Bottom line, if you
                know you want to do a trip go ahead and register as soon as you know!</p>

                <h4>I've never hiked or backpacked before - is that a problem?</h4>
                <p>No, prior experience backpacking or hiking is not required or expected to join any of our trips. 
                    What is important is that your physical fitness matches the difficulty of the trip you choose.</p>
            
                <h4>What equipment or clothing is required to wear?</h4>
                <p>At the time of making your purchase, you will receive a guide for what clothing, accessories, and equipment to bring to
                your experiences.</p>

                <h4>What is included in the trip?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guides trained in first aid.</li>
                    <li>First aid kit.</li>
                    <li>Snacks.</li>
                    <li>Hydration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Important: We will provide a drink at the end of the experience. Hydration such as water and energy or moisturizing
                    drinks is the responsibility of each person to carry in their backpack.</p>
