    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Hania Flores and I’m from Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, currently living in Monterrey,
    Nuevo Leon.<p>
    <p>I love nature and the sea and watch documentaries about science and technology.</p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time playing video games and listening to music.</p>
    <p>I’m pursuing a degree in Applied Technology because I always have been interested in programming, robots, and AI.<p>
