        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This website will help the company to show pictures and a brief description of the trips we offer to attract new clients
        and elevate the sales rate of the company. It will be easier for new clients to find us through the internet than having
        to go to the actual place to know about our services.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The people who we want to attract are young adults who are interested in extreme sports or water sports, have a good
        financial situation, and have friends with the same interest as them. They want a place to have fun that isn't too far
        from the city so they can visit it on the weekend because they have a job. They have an explorer personality and need to
        have enough doses of adrenaline and happiness. Since most of the clients will be young adults, they will mostly visit
        the site on their mobile devices.</p>
