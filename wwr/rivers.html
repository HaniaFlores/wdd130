            <p id="description1">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon has given the nickname long
                ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so
                in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>

                <p id="description1">Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

            <h3 id="subtitle2">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
            <p id="description2">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the
                mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run
                famous.</p>

                <summary>More Details</summary>
                <p id="description2">Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich
                    history that the canyon tells. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>

            <!-- Grand Canyon -->
            <h3 id="subtitle3">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
            <p id="description3">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the
                Grand Canyon. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins
                accessible only by river.</p>

                <summary>More Details</summary>
                <p id="description3">The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
